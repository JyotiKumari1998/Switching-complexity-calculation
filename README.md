# Switching-complexity-calculation

Through this project, we have tried to get an idea of complexity and other design parameters for different type of switches like ( S, SSS, STS, TST, STTTS, TSSST, TSSSST). A switch, in the context of networking, is a high-speed device that receives incoming data packets and redirects them to their destination. An important question here is that, why do we need to analyze the behaviour of these switches. All of us uses telephones,  browses the internet almost every day. So how does all this happen; in the case of telephony, we do have exchanges, in case of the internet we have routers. The flow of information happens through these switches. To understand the working of the telephonic system or Internet or to design these systems we have to understand the properties like switching complexity which controls the performance of these switches (which in turn determines packet flow speed) in network infrastructure.
